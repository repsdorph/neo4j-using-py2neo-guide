# neo4j-using-py2neo-guide
This is going to be my guide with all the findings i get about hosting a <a href="http://neo4j.com">Neo4J</a> server, and interacting wit it via <a href="http://py2neo.org">Py2Neo</a>. It is also going to include some pratical examples of the bedst pratic I've found.

The reasom for making it on github, is both to share, and have other pitch in with better ideas and ways of doing stuff.. :-)
